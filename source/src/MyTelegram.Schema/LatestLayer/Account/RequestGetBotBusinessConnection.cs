/// This method can be used to fetch info about a not-yet-cached business connection, and should not be invoked if the info is already cached or to fetch changes, as eventual changes will automatically be sent as new <a href="https://corefork.telegram.org/constructor/updateBotBusinessConnect">updateBotBusinessConnect</a> updates to the bot using the usual <a href="https://corefork.telegram.org/api/updates">update delivery methods »</a>.
